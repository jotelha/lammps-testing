# Tests for USER-NETCDF functionality

USER-NETCDF can be built with NetCDF or PNetCDF library, or both.
Builds with NetCDF library offer the "netcdf" dump style, builds
with PNetCDF offer "netcdf/mpiio".

## Content

* comp.sh, diff_avgsqr_ref.txt, lmp_netcdf_avgsqr.nco: see section "Manual testing" below
* in.header: test system common to all test cases, taken from standard LJ benchmark
* in.netcdf.*: test cases, see below

## Manual testing

For intense manual testing, the bash script "comp.sh" together
with ncap2 script "lmp_netcdf_avgsqr.nco" form an example on 
how to compare output NetCDF trajectories by evaluating the 
root mean square average of differences in coordinates,
velocities and forces. NCO operators are required for that
purpose.

## Test cases:

* in.netcdf.standard                dump_style netcdf
* in.netcdf.mpiio                   dump_style netcdf/mpiio
* in.netcdf.compute                 custom compute in NetCDF dump
* in.netcdf.compute.wildcard        custom compute by wildcard in NetCDF dump (always fails with internal error)
* in.netcdf.variable                custom variable in NetCDF dump
* in.netcdf.thermo                  append thermo data to NetCDF dump
* in.netcdf.thermo.variable         append thermo data with custom variable to NetCDF dump
* in.netcdf.thermo.variable.compute append thermo data with custom variable and custom compute (latter by wildcard in thermo_style) to NetCDF dump
